"""Values inside nested objects: find them, name them, and flag ambiguity (issue #33).

A property mapping names where a value is stored. ``field`` is one literal attribute
name; ``path`` (a list, one name per level) names a value inside a nested object. The
dotted spelling ``address.city`` cannot say which it means: ``city`` inside the object
``address``, or one top-level attribute named exactly ``address.city``. So the analyzer
decides once, here, from what the sampled documents actually hold, and writes ``path`` or
``field`` to match. A reader never has to guess at query time.

**Flag, don't guess.** When one collection holds two shapes under the same dotted name,
the sample cannot say which one a caller means, so neither gets a mapping. The name is
reported under ``metadata.nestedFields.conflicts`` (and carried into CSI provenance) for a
person to settle.

**Lists are a later step.** A list of objects partway along a path is not walked:
readers treat a value behind a list as absent. Each one met is recorded under
``arraysSkipped`` so it is not silently missing.

Opt-in and depth-limited (``analysisOptions.nestedFieldDepth``, default 0): with depth 0
nothing here runs and the analyzer's output is unchanged.
