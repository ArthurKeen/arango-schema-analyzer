"""Class-abstraction discovery (PRD §6.3), delegated to ``conceptual-taxonomy``.

Discovering `rdfs:subClassOf` from a schema is paradigm-neutral — it reads entity names,
property sets, and relationships, and never touches AQL. `relational-schema-analyzer` needs
the identical capability over the identical bundle shape, so the mechanisms live in a shared
library and this module is only the adapter: it assembles the two inputs that *do* need
ArangoDB knowledge, and folds the proposals back into an analysis.

Optional dependency. Without it the analyzer degrades to no abstraction discovery rather
than failing, matching how every other optional capability behaves here.
