"""Deterministic type-discriminator heuristics for the physical snapshot.

Pure helpers extracted from ``snapshot.py``: given sample documents and the
per-field value distributions the snapshot collects, decide which field (if
any) acts as a type discriminator, and derive conceptual names from collection
names. No database access — every function operates on plain dicts/strings —
so they are cheap to unit-test in isolation.

``snapshot.py`` re-exports these names, so existing imports such as
``from schema_analyzer.snapshot import _pick_best_type_field`` keep working.
